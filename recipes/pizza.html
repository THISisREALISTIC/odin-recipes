    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

        In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.
